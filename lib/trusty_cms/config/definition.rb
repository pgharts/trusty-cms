      # Configuration 'definitions' are metadata held in memory that add restriction and description to individual config entries.
      #
      # By default trusty's configuration machinery is open and ad-hoc: config items are just globally-accessible variables.
      # They're created when first mentioned and then available in all parts of the application. The definition mechanism is a way
      # to place limits on that behavior. It allows you to protect a config entry, to specify the values it can take and to
      # validate it when it changes. In the next update it will also allow you to declare that
      # a config item is global or site-specific.
      #
      # The actual defining is done by TrustyCms::Config#define and usually in a block like this:
      #
      #   TrustyCms::Config.prepare do |config|
      #     config.namespace('users', :allow_change => true) do |users|
      #       users.define 'allow_password_reset?', :label => 'Allow password reset?'
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # See the method documentation in TrustyCms::Config for options and conventions.
      #
