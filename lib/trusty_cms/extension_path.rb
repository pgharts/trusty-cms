  class ExtensionPath
    # This class holds information about extensions that may be loaded. It has two roles: to remember the
    # location of the extension so that we don't have to search for it again, and to look within that path
    # for significant application subdirectories.
    #
    # We can't just retrieve this information from the Extension class because the initializer sets up
    # most of the application load_paths before plugins (including extensions) are loaded. You can think
    # of this as a sort of pre-extension class preparing the way for extension loading.
    #
    # You can use instances of this class to retrieve information about a particular extension:
    #
    #   ExtensionPath.new(:name, :path)
    #   ExtensionPath.find(:name)               #=> ExtensionPath instance
    #   ExtensionPath.find(:name).plugin_paths  #=> "path/vendor/plugins" if it exists and is a directory
    #   ExtensionPath.for(:name)                #=> "path"
    #
    # The initializer calls class methods to get overall lists (in configured order) of enabled load paths:
    #
    #   ExtensionPath.enabled                   #=> ["path", "path", "path", "path"]
    #   ExtensionPath.plugin_paths              #=> ["path/vendor/plugins", "path/vendor/plugins"]
