## Welcome to TrustyCMS

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/trusty-cms.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/trusty-cms)

TrustyCMS is a branch of Radiant CMS. Its goal is to pull the Radiant framework into Rails 7 with minimal changes to its
infrastructure.

TrustyCMS is a no-fluff, open source content management system designed for
small teams. It is similar to Textpattern or MovableType, but is a general
purpose content management system (not just a blogging engine). TrustyCMS is a
Rails engine and is built to be installed into an existing Rails 7 application as a gem.

TrustyCMS features:

* An elegant user interface
* The ability to arrange pages in a hierarchy with drag and drop
* Flexible templating with layouts, snippets, page parts, and a custom tagging
  language

  create other filters)
* An advanced plugin system
* Asset management & searching
* Serve multiple sites (domains) from a single instance
* Social sharing buttons
* Reusable bits of content (Snippets)
* Allows Rails controllers/actions to use Trusty CMS layouts as their "layout"
* Operates in two modes: dev and production depending on the URL
* A caching system which expires pages every 5 minutes
* Built using Ruby on Rails (version 7)

## Installation and Setup for Use

TrustyCMS is a traditional Ruby on Rails engine, meaning that you can
configure and run it the way you would a normal gem, like [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

See the INSTALL.md file for more instructions.

### Installation and Setup for Contributing to TrustyCMS

#### Setup

Prerequisites:

* A Github account and Git ([Github has some really good instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git))
* Ruby 3.1 or higher
* A Rails application (currently supports version 7.0)
* Bundler
* MySQL
* [PhantomJS >= 1.8.1](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist/tree/v1.5.0#installing-phantomjs)

Steps:

1. Fork this repository to your Github account.
1. Clone your fork to your machine.
1. `cd` into the directory you just cloned into.
1. Follow the INSTALL.md instructions to setup an empty app with TrustyCMS installed. To modify TrustyCMS,
   point your dependency to the local path of your fork.

   gem 'trusty-cms', path: '../trusty-cms'

1. Set up your databases in your Rails application:

        bundle exec rake db:create
        bundle exec rake db:migrate

1. Run the tests to make sure they pass (If they don't, file a bug!):

        rspec

When you're ready to make a change:

1. Add the pgharts fork as a git remote called "upstream":
   `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pgharts/trusty-cms.git` so that you can keep up with changes that other
   people make.
1. Fetch the remote you just added: `git fetch upstream`.
1. Start a new branch for the change you're going to make. Name it something having to do with the changes, like "
   fix-queries" if you are going to try to fix some queries. Base this branch on `upstream/master` by running
   `git checkout -b fix-queries upstream/master`.
1. Make your changes and commit them. Please include tests!
1. Run the tests and make sure they pass.
1. Push your changes to your github fork: `git push origin fix-queries`.
1. Send a pull request to the pgharts fork.
