# Installation and Setup

From within the directory containing your TrustyCMS instance:

1. Create a new Rails 7.0+ application (i.e. `rails new [project_name]`)

2. Add the following gems to your Gemfile:

- gem 'trusty-cms'
- gem 'rails-observers'

3. Run `bundle install`

4. Run the Trusty CMS generator to get the project into shape: `rails g trusty_cms [project_name]`.
    - This will ask you if you want to replace a number of existing files (like application.rb); reply Y to all.

5. add config.extensions = [ :snippets, :clipped, :layouts, :multi_site ] to enable them in application.rb

7. Add utf8 encoding to your db.yml

6. Run `bundle exec rake db:setup`, `bundle exec rake trusty_cms:install:migrations`, then
   `bundle exec rake db:bootstrap`.
